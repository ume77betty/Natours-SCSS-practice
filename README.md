#### **--- About Natours ---**
This website is mainly for **practicing SCSS and RWD**.
<br />
It's made of **pure HTML and CSS**, this website has modern design and animation, it broke my imagination of CSS!
<br/>
<br/>
Through this course, I understood how to use Sass in my projects, also, I learned how to manage my CSS file well.
<br/>
Now, I know how to write maintainable and scalable code.
<br/>
In this course, I learned a lot of novel CSS animation, and it really makes website more modern than before!
<br/>
Not only CSS animation, but I also gain knowledge about how to write good RWD code.
<br/>
I can think about the inconvenience of the website from the userâ€™s point of view, and then make improvements.
<br/>
This course is really useful and very helpful for me!
